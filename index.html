At the time the bay was under French control and was completely part of the French Empire from the 17th century to the 20th century. The Senegal bay was also the headquaters for the French to receive goods like gold, acaica gum and other resources.</p></div>

The end goal of this was to allow French to be a main part of Senegalese people's way of communication. The French colonisers took over the education system, which they taught in French, about its culture and used French textbooks. They made this seem to the Senegalese people that the French way of living is far more established than the Senegalese way of living. Even now French is the native/official language of Senegal.</p></div>

One of the founders was the very first President of Senegal at the time, Léopold Sédar Senghor. It was a movement that allowed the publishing of African works of art and literature across the entirety of Europe and the whole world. These were the works that celebrated African culture for its own worth.</p></div>

They also helped gain respect for the African people because they showed their art and literature. The education system also changed from the French colonisation and was able to help children move away from their usual language and be taught to use French. The only downside being those who couldn't afford education were stuck with using the more native language Wolof, that was used before French was the more predominant language spoken.</p></div>
